# Biology Cheatsheet

## Branches

- Genetic engineering: modifying organisms by changing their DNA
- Molecular biology: analysis of organisms at the molecular level
- Synthetic biology: engineering biological components
- Genetics: studying genes and how they affect populations

## Genetics

### Basic gene structure (top down)

- Promoter: place where protein binds to RNA to start transcription
- Kozac/RBS: where the ribosome binds to the RNA
- Start codon: the codon that indicates the start of the protein sequence
- Coding sequence: the RNA that codes the protein sequence
- Stop codon: the codon that indicates the end of the protein sequence
- Terminator: where the ribosome releases the RNA

## üìå Overview

**Biology** is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It explores:
- How life is structured
- How organisms function
- How life evolves and interacts with the environment

Biology spans many fields, including genetics, ecology, physiology, microbiology, and evolutionary biology.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Characteristics of Life

All living things share certain traits:
1. **Cellular organization** ‚Äì Made of one or more cells.
2. **Metabolism** ‚Äì Chemical reactions that sustain life.
3. **Homeostasis** ‚Äì Maintaining internal stability.
4. **Growth and development** ‚Äì Changes over an organism's life cycle.
5. **Reproduction** ‚Äì Producing new organisms.
6. **Response to stimuli** ‚Äì Reacting to the environment.
7. **Evolution** ‚Äì Populations change over generations.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Levels of Biological Organization

From smallest to largest:
1. **Atom** ‚Üí Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen  
2. **Molecule** ‚Üí DNA, proteins  
3. **Organelle** ‚Üí Mitochondria, chloroplasts  
4. **Cell** ‚Üí Basic unit of life  
5. **Tissue** ‚Üí Muscle, nervous  
6. **Organ** ‚Üí Heart, lungs  
7. **Organ system** ‚Üí Circulatory, respiratory  
8. **Organism** ‚Üí Individual living thing  
9. **Population** ‚Üí Same species in one area  
10. **Community** ‚Üí Multiple populations  
11. **Ecosystem** ‚Üí Living + nonliving interactions  
12. **Biosphere** ‚Üí All life on Earth

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Cell ‚Äì The Basic Unit of Life

Two main types:
- **Prokaryotic cells** ‚Äì No nucleus (bacteria, archaea)
- **Eukaryotic cells** ‚Äì Have a nucleus and organelles (plants, animals, fungi, protists)

### Common cell structures:
- **Cell membrane** ‚Äì Controls entry/exit of substances
- **Cytoplasm** ‚Äì Gel-like fluid inside cell
- **Nucleus** ‚Äì Contains DNA
- **Ribosomes** ‚Äì Protein synthesis
- **Mitochondria** ‚Äì Energy production
- **Chloroplasts** (plants) ‚Äì Photosynthesis

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ DNA and Genetics

- **DNA** (Deoxyribonucleic acid) stores genetic instructions.
- **Genes** are segments of DNA coding for proteins.
- **Chromosomes** are DNA molecules packaged with proteins.
- **Genotype** ‚Äì Genetic makeup.
- **Phenotype** ‚Äì Observable traits.

**Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**:
```
DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí Protein
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Energy in Biology

Organisms need energy to live:
- **Autotrophs** ‚Äì Make their own food (plants via photosynthesis).
- **Heterotrophs** ‚Äì Consume other organisms (animals, fungi).

**ATP** (Adenosine triphosphate) is the energy currency of the cell.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Evolution and Natural Selection

- **Evolution** ‚Äì Change in populations over time.
- **Natural selection** ‚Äì Traits that improve survival become more common.
- **Adaptation** ‚Äì Traits shaped by natural selection.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Ecology Basics

Ecology studies interactions between organisms and their environment.

Key terms:
- **Habitat** ‚Äì Where an organism lives.
- **Niche** ‚Äì Role an organism plays.
- **Food chain** ‚Äì Sequence of who eats whom.
- **Food web** ‚Äì Interconnected food chains.
- **Biomes** ‚Äì Large regions with specific climate and life forms.

## üî¨ Practical Biology Skills

1. **Microscopy** ‚Äì Using microscopes to view cells and microorganisms.
2. **Observation** ‚Äì Recording natural phenomena.
3. **Experimentation** ‚Äì Testing hypotheses with controlled variables.
4. **Data analysis** ‚Äì Using graphs, statistics, and models.
