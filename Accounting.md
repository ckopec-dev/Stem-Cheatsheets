## Income and expenses

- Income: all monies received by the business in any given period of time (sales of goods, services, interest, etc.) Should always deposits.
- Expenses: all monies paid out by the business (by check, cash, etc.) Four main categories but some items cover multiple.
  - Cost of goods sold (inventory)
  - Variable (selling) expenses (e.g. marketing costs, r&d)
  - Fixed administrative (office overhead of accounting, legal, utilities, etc.)
  - Other (interest income, etc.)
- Expense types:
  - Deductible: deductible entirely in the year in which they are incurred
    - Need to be itemized and receipts kept.
    - E.g. office supplies, postage
  - Depreciable: deducted over a fixed number of years
    - Property not be resold that has an expected life of more than a year.
    - E.g. buildings, machinery, equipment

## Cash vs accrual accounting

These two types are exclusive and should be established as early as possible. Very different to change.

- Cash: the reporting of income and expenses at the time they were received or paid.
 - Most common method because it is simple and direct.
 - Can use single entry.
 - Taxes are paid on the cash received.
- Accrual: the reporting of income and expenses at the time they are incurred, regardless of when the transaction actually happened.
 - Generally used when company has inventory and/or over gross receipts over $5 million and/or is a C corp.
 - Provides better insight into how sales map to transactions.
 - Requires double entry.
 - Taxes are paid on invoices (not necessarily paid.)

## Single entry accounting

- Uses only income and expense accounts. main requirements:
  - Revenue & expense journal: recording receipts and expenditures
  - General records: petty cash, fixed assets, accounts payable + receivable, inventory, mileage, travel, and customer info
  - Flow of data: **transaction** &larr;&rarr; **document** &larr;&rarr; **revenue & expense journal**

### Revenue & expense journal

Used to record the transactions of a business. 

- Revenues are transactions for which monies are received.
- Expenses are transactions for which monies are paid out.
- Each entry is recorded **twice**: once as a summary, and then as the detail.
- Basic columns: check number, date, transaction, revenue, expense. Additional columns are for the revenue and expense categories/details.
- A final miscellanous column will handle anything outside the scope of the core columns.
- Every column should be totaled.

## Double entry accounting

- Double entry: every transaction is recorded as debits and credits because every transaction has two sides
  - The debits and credits should always equal
 
## A chart of accounts (COA)

A comprehensive, organized list of all the financial accounts a company uses to record its transactions. It acts as the foundation of an accounting system, assigning each financial category, such as assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses, a unique identifier.

### Balance sheet accounts

  - Cash in bank
  - Petty cash
  - Accounts receivable
  - Inventory
  - Prepaid expenses
  - Fixed assets (land, vehicles, etc)

The entity giving in the transaction is the credit and the one receiving is the debit. E.g. if you sell an hour of your service, the service revenue is the giver (credited) and the cash in the bank is receiver (debitor)
