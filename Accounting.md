## Income and expenses

- Income: all monies received by the business in any given period of time (sales of goods, services, interest, etc.) Should always deposits.
- Expenses: all monies paid out by the business (by check, cash, etc.) Four main categories but some items cover multiple.
  - Cost of goods sold (inventory)
  - Variable (selling) expenses (e.g. marketing costs, r&d)
  - Fixed administrative (office overhead of accounting, legal, utilities, etc.)
  - Other (interest income, etc.)
- Expense types:
  - Deductible: deductible entirely in the year in which they are incurred
    - Need to be itemized and receipts kept.
    - E.g. office supplies, postage
  - Depreciable: deducted over a fixed number of years
    - Property not be resold that has an expected life of more than a year.
    - E.g. buildings, machinery, equipment

## Cash vs accrual accounting

These two types are exclusive and should be established as early as possible. Very different to change.

- Cash: the reporting of income and expenses at the time they were received or paid.
 - Most common method because it is simple and direct.
 - Can use single entry.
 - Taxes are paid on the cash received.
- Accrual: the reporting of income and expenses at the time they are incurred, regardless of when the transaction actually happened.
 - Generally used when company has inventory and/or over gross receipts over $5 million and/or is a C corp.
 - Provides better insight into how sales map to transactions.
 - Requires double entry.
 - Taxes are paid on invoices (not necessarily paid.)

## Basic bookkeeping methods

- Single entry: uses only income and expense accounts. main requirements:
  - Revenue & expense journal: recording receipts and expenditures
  - General records: petty cash, fixed assets, accounts payable + receivable, inventory, mileage, travel, and customer info
- Double entry: every transaction is recorded as debits and credits because every transaction has two sides
  - The debits and credits should always equal
