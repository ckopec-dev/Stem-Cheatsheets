## The periodic table

- Top left: symbol
- Top right: atomic number - the number of protons in an atom (and the number of electrons).
- Top center: full name
- Bottom center: atomic weight
- Period: a row running left to right.
- Group: a column running top to bottom.

## Acids and bases

- Acids react with metals.
- Acids neutralize bases, and vice-versa.
- An acid is a substance that will donate protons.
- Acids in solution liberate protons as H+ ions.
- A base is a substance that will accept protons.
- Bases in solution liberate hydroxyl ions (OH-).
- Titration is used to determine the unknown strength of an acid or base.

## Reaction types

- Direct combination: two or more substances combine to form a single substance.
- Decomposition: the opposite of direct combination – a single substance decomposes into multiple substances
- Single displacement: one element takes the place of another in a compound.
- Double displacement: two compounds change partners with each other.

## Equations

- Create a trial equation, for example: reacting aluminum with hydrochloric acid – Al + HCl -> AlCl + H.
- Check valences of compounds and correct ratios: Al + HCl -> AlCl<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>. 
- Balance: 2AL + 6HCl -> 2AlCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> &uarr;.
- Up arrow refers to a gas.
- Down arrow refers to a precipitate.
- Take into account water of hydration, if applicable.
- Take into account solubility.
- Calculate weight of all components to determine inputs and outputs.

## Solubility of salts and hydroxides in water

- Nitrates: soluble without exception
- Acetates: soluble without exception
- Chlorides: soluble except Ag, Hg (Mercurous), and Pb
- Sulfates: soluble except Pb, Ba, Sr. Ca, Ag, and Hg slightly soluble
- Normal carbonates, phosphates, silicates, sulfides: insoluble except Na, K, NH4
- Hydroxides: insoluble except Na, K, NH4, Ba. Ca and Sr slightly soluble

## Tapered glassware

Standard taper glassware with ground glass joints is 19/22 or 14/20.   
The numbers refer to diameter and length, in millimeters, of the joints.  
14/20 is used for microscale experiments.  

## Crystal forms

- Cubic (isometric): 3 axes of equal length and are at right angles to each other (e.g. a cube). Examples: galena, garnet, pyrite, halite.
- Tetragonal: 2 axes of equal length and 1 unequal. All 3 are at right angles to each other. Examples: zircon, rutile, cassiterite.
- Hexagonal: 3 equal axes  at 120 degrees arranged in 1 plane and one more axis of a different length at right angles to these. Examples: quartz, beryl, calcite, tourmaline, cinnabar.
-	Orthorhombic: 3 unequal axes all at right angles. Examples: sulfur, barite, celestite, staurolite, olivine.
-	Monoclinic: 3 unequal axes, two of which are not at right angles. The 3rd makes a right angle to the plane of the other two. Examples: orthoclase, gypsum, micas, augite, epidote, hornblende.
-	Triclinic: 3 unequal axes, none of which forms a right angle with any other. Examples: plagioclase feldspars, rhodonite, chalcanthite.

## Mineral hardness

- If object A scratches object B, it is harder and therefore higher on the Mohs’ scale (an arbitrary scale from 1-10).

Examples:

1. Talc
2. Gypsum
2.5 Fingernail
3. Calcite
4. Fluorite
5. Apatite
5.5 Window glass, Knife blade
6. Orthoclase
6.5 Steel file
7. Quartz
8. Topaz
9. Corundum
10. Diamond

## Specific gravity

Specific gravity is the relative weight of a mineral compared to the weight of an equal volume of water.

To determine specific gravity:
- Weigh sample (rock), e.g. 36.2g
- Wrap string around sample
- Fill beaker with water (enough to cover sample without it touching bottom)
- Place beaker on scale and tare it
- Lower sample into water (without it touching bottom)
- Take weight measurement, e.g. 14.2g
- Specific gravity is weight of sample / weight in water, e.g. 36.2 / 14.2 = 2.55

## Various techniques

### Make a 2% solution

- Add 1g solute to 40 ml distilled water. If desired, heat to reduce dissolving time. 
- Pour solution in to 100 ml graduated cylinder. 
- Add distilled water to bring it to 50 ml.

### Make a 10% solution

- Add 5g solute to 40 ml distilled water. If desired, heat to reduce dissolving time. 
- Pour solution in to 100 ml graduated cylinder. 
- Add distilled water to bring it to 50 ml.

### Make phenolphthalein indicator solution
	
- Dissolve 0.05g phenolphthalein powder in 50 ml denatured alcohol.

### Make iodine indicator
	
- Dissolve 0.10g corn starch in 5 ml distilled water.
- Heat 100 ml water to boiling.
- Add mixture to boiling water and stir to combine.
- Remove from heat and let cool.
- Solution turns bright blue when iodine is present.
- Can test with medicinal iodine tincture.

### Detect acids

- Acids turn blue litmus paper red.

### Detect bases

- Bases turn red litmus paper blue.
-	Bases turn phenolphthalein solution pink.

### Decantation
	
- Let liquid stand until insoluble matter has settled.
- Pour off the liquid.

### Filtration
	 
- Pass liquid through a funnel lined with filter paper.
- Cleared liquid is called "filtrate".

### Evaporation

- Boiling away the liquid to reveal the solid.

 ### Crystallization

- The result of evaporation.

### Saturization
	
- Add solute into a solution until no more will dissolve at a given temperature.

### Solutions
	
- An x% solution has x% of solute dissolved in solution.
- The solution is by volume and the solute is by weight.

### Titration
	
- Neutralize an acid or base to determine its strength.
