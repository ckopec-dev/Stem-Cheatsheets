## Introduction to Organic Chemistry

Organic chemistry is the study of carbon-containing compounds and their properties, structures, reactions, and synthesis. Carbon's unique ability to form four covalent bonds and create stable chains, rings, and complex three-dimensional structures makes it the foundation of life and an incredibly diverse field of study.

### Why Carbon is Special

Carbon atoms have four valence electrons, allowing them to form four covalent bonds. This tetrahedral geometry and the ability to bond with other carbon atoms creates virtually unlimited structural possibilities. Carbon can form single, double, and triple bonds, creating compounds ranging from simple methane (CH₄) to complex biomolecules like DNA.

### Basic Principles

- **Covalent Bonding**: Organic compounds primarily involve covalent bonds where electrons are shared between atoms
- **Structural Diversity**: The same molecular formula can represent different compounds (isomers)
- **Functional Groups**: Specific arrangements of atoms that determine chemical behavior
- **Electron Movement**: Understanding how electrons move during reactions is crucial for predicting outcomes
