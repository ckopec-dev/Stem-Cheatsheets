# Unity3D Cheatsheet

## Basics

### Main windows

- Project: all the files in the project. Works like a file explorer.
- Hierarchy: all the GameObjects in the current scene, arranged in a tree structure with parents and children. Double-clicking a GameObject focuses it in the scene and populates the Inspector window with properties that apply to it.
- Scene: this is the game world (imagine your head is facing a movie set).
  - Right-click and hold to move the view around (like moving your head around).
  - Up/down arrows move you forward and backward (like moving your head closer or farther).

### Scene toolbar (in upper left of scene)
  - Pan: looks like a hand. Select and left-click the scene to pan around (like moving your head left/right and up/down).
