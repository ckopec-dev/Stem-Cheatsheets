# Unity3D Cheatsheet

## Basics

### Main windows

- Project: all the files in the project. Works like a file explorer.
- Hierarchy: all the GameObjects in the current scene, arranged in a tree structure with parents and children. Double-clicking a GameObject focuses it in the scene and populates the Inspector window with properties that apply to it.
- Scene: this is the game world (imagine your head is facing a movie set).
  - View: Hold the right mouse button and drag.
  - Frame: Press F in the Scene view or double-click a GameObject in the Hierarchy window.
  - Orbit:  Hold Alt (macOS: hold Option) and left mouse button drag.
  - Zoom: Scroll wheel or hold Alt (macOS: hold Option) and right mouse button drag.
  - Flythrough mode: Hold the right mouse button and use the WASD keys (as well as the Q and E keys to move Down and Up).
- Inspector: properties and behaviors of GameObjects.

### Scene modes (the tab buttons and play controls)

- Scene (the default)
- Game: the view through the camera
